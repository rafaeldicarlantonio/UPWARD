# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data. Neural networks are powerful models inspired by the human brain.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning uses multi-layered neural networks to process complex patterns. These networks can achieve state-of-the-art performance on image recognition tasks.

## Key Concepts

- Supervised learning trains models on labeled data
- Unsupervised learning discovers patterns without labels
- Reinforcement learning learns through trial and error

## Applications

Machine learning powers recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing applications.
