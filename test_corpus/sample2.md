# Neural Networks in Practice

Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons. Each neuron performs a weighted sum of its inputs followed by a non-linear activation function.

## Architecture

A typical neural network has:
- Input layer for receiving data
- Hidden layers for feature extraction
- Output layer for predictions

## Training Process

Neural networks learn by adjusting weights through backpropagation. The gradient descent algorithm minimizes the loss function iteratively.

## Challenges

However, neural networks can be difficult to train and require large amounts of data. They also suffer from overfitting when the model memorizes training data instead of learning general patterns.

## Contradictory Views

Some researchers claim neural networks are inherently interpretable through visualization techniques. Others argue that neural networks are fundamentally black boxes that cannot be understood.
