# AI Ethics and Safety

Artificial intelligence systems must be developed responsibly with ethical considerations. Safety mechanisms are critical for preventing harm.

## Alignment

AI alignment ensures that systems behave according to human values and intentions. Misaligned AI could pursue goals that conflict with human welfare.

## Bias and Fairness

Machine learning models can perpetuate and amplify biases present in training data. Fair AI requires careful dataset curation and bias detection.

## Contradictions in Practice

Recent studies show that AI systems reduce bias in hiring decisions by using objective criteria. However, other research demonstrates that AI hiring tools amplify racial and gender biases from historical data.

The AI safety community believes that advanced AI poses existential risks. Meanwhile, many AI researchers consider such concerns to be overblown and premature.
